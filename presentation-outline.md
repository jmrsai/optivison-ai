**Slide 2: The Problem - Challenges in Modern Ophthalmology**

*   **Title:** The Growing Burden on Eye Care Professionals
*   **Key Points:**
    *   **Increasing Patient Volume:** An aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases like diabetes are leading to more eye exams.
    *   **Information Overload:** Clinicians must synthesize data from patient history, clinical notes, and complex imaging (OCT, fundus scans).
    *   **Early Detection is Crucial:** Subtle, early signs of progressive diseases like glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy are easily missed, leading to irreversible vision loss.
    *   **Time Constraints:** Manual analysis and reporting are time-consuming, reducing patient throughput.
*   **Visual:** A graphic illustrating the complexity of data points a doctor has to manage.

**Slide 3: Our Solution - Introducing OptiVision AI**

*   **Title:** Your Intelligent Partner in Ophthalmic Diagnostics
*   **Core Statement:** OptiVision AI is an advanced EHR that leverages state-of-the-art AI to provide ophthalmologists with rapid, data-driven diagnostic insights, enhancing clinical efficiency and improving patient outcomes.
*   **Key Benefits:**
    *   **Augment, Not Replace:** Acts as a powerful "second opinion" to augment the clinician's expertise.
    *   **Early & Accurate Detection:** Identifies subtle biomarkers and patterns often invisible to the human eye.
    *   **Streamlined Workflow:** Automates analysis and report generation, saving valuable clinical time.

**Slide 4: Core Features - A Comprehensive Toolkit**

*   **Title:** An Integrated Suite of AI-Powered Tools
*   **Feature 1: AI-Driven Diagnostic Analysis**
    *   Analyzes eye scans and correlates findings with patient history and external medical documents.
    *   Provides diagnostic insights, risk assessment, and treatment suggestions.
*   **Feature 2: Longitudinal Progression Analysis**
    *   Tracks and visualizes disease progression over time by comparing multiple scans.
    *   Identifies trends to inform treatment adjustments.
*   **Feature 3: Multi-Modal Data Synthesis**
    *   Uniquely analyzes both imaging (scans) and text (PDF reports, notes) for a holistic patient view.
*   **Feature 4: Automated Reporting**
    *   Instantly generates professional, downloadable PDF reports for medical records.
*   **Visual:** A collage of screenshots showing the "New Analysis" sheet, a scan card with results, and the longitudinal analysis chart.

**Slide 5: Live Demo / Workflow Walkthrough**

*   **Title:** From Patient Scan to Actionable Insight
*   **Step 1: Patient Selection:** Show the Clinician Dashboard and selecting a patient.
*   **Step 2: Initiate New Analysis:** Navigate to the patient page and click "New Analysis."
*   **Step 3: Upload Data:** Demonstrate uploading an eye scan image and an optional medical document (PDF). Add clinical notes.
*   **Step 4: Review AI Results:** Show the newly generated Scan Card with the AI's "Diagnostic Insights," "Potential Abnormalities," and "Recommendations."
*   **Step 5: Generate Progression Report:** For a patient with multiple scans, demonstrate running the "Longitudinal Analysis" to see the risk progression chart.
*   **Step 6: Download Report:** Show the one-click PDF download feature.
